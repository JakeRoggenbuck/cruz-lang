Cruz is a high-level, statically strongly typed, and compiled language that offers low-level facilities and has a syntax broadly inspired by C and its descendants.


OFFICIAL HIGHLIGHTING FOR WRITING CODE HERE:
* Control flow words (if, else, for, while, break, etc.) are green
* Built-in variable types are purple
* When defined for the first time, variables and functions are orange
* Dark blue is for struct, function, member
* Comments are gray


Aight let’s write some code


IF:
if (condition) {
        code
} elif (other condition) {
        more code
} else {
        yet more code
}


WHILE:
while (condition) {
        code
}


FUNCTIONS:
~ function foo (takes int age, int height) returns string {
        return(“your age is ” + string(age) + “and your height is ” + string(height))
} ~
function foo takes (int age, int height) returns string {
        return(“your age is ” + string(age) + “, and your height is ” + string(height))
}
~ function foo (takes int age, int height returns string) {
        return(“your age is ” + string(age) + “and your height is ” + string(height))
} ~


foo(10, 20, 150)
EXPONS:
if (age is 10) {
        write(“Happy Birthday!”)
}


read(“What’s your age?”)


write(“What’s your age?”)
int age = read()

Data types
* byte 8 bits of data
* char one ASCII character
* int a 32 bit integer
* prec a number with a decimal point of 32 bits
* ptr a 4 byte pointer address
